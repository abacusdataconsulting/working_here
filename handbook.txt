This diversity allows us to provide comprehensive solutions to our clients
while offering varied and engaging work for our team members.

MISSION STATEMENT

[Mission statement to be finalized]

Our guiding principle: Empowering better decisions through data.

ABOUT THIS HANDBOOK

This handbook outlines the policies, procedures, and expectations for everyone
at Abacus Data Consulting. It serves as a reference guide to help you understand
how we operate. Policies may be updated as the company grows, and you will be
notified of any significant changes.

This handbook is not a contract of employment and does not guarantee employment
for any specific duration.

================================================================================
                       2. EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
================================================================================

EMPLOYMENT TYPES

Abacus Data Consulting engages team members in various capacities:

  - Independent Contractors: Our primary engagement model. Contractors work on
    defined projects or ongoing arrangements while maintaining their independent
    business status.

  - Part-Time Employees: Team members working fewer than standard full-time
    hours on a regular schedule.

  - Other Arrangements: We remain open to other employment structures as the
    company evolves.

Your specific employment type and terms will be outlined in your offer letter
or contract.

AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT

For employees (as opposed to independent contractors), employment with Abacus
Data Consulting is at-will. This means that either you or the company may end
the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice,
subject to applicable law.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

Abacus Data Consulting is committed to providing equal opportunity in all
aspects of employment. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion,
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability,
veteran status, or any other protected characteristic under applicable law.

PROBATIONARY PERIOD

All new team members undergo a probationary period of two (2) months from their
first day. During this time:

  - You and the company can assess whether the role is a good fit
  - You will receive guidance and feedback on your performance
  - A formal performance review will occur at the end of this period
  - Certain benefits (such as use of accrued time off) become available after
    successful completion of the probationary period

Completion of the probationary period does not guarantee continued employment
or change your at-will status.

================================================================================
                     3. WORK SCHEDULE & TIME OFF
================================================================================

WORK HOURS

As a fully remote company, we embrace flexibility. There are no mandatory core
hours. We trust you to manage your time effectively and complete your work
responsibilities. The focus is on results and deliverables rather than hours
logged.

That said, you should:
  - Be reasonably available during standard business hours for collaboration
  - Communicate proactively if you'll be unavailable for extended periods
  - Meet deadlines and commitments to clients and team members

REMOTE WORK

Abacus Data Consulting operates without a physical office. All work is conducted
remotely using web-based communication and collaboration tools. You are
responsible for maintaining a suitable workspace and reliable internet connection.

HOLIDAYS

We do not observe a fixed holiday schedule. Time off for holidays is flexible
and can be arranged based on your workload and project commitments. Please
coordinate with your team to ensure coverage when needed.

VACATION / PAID TIME OFF

  - During Probationary Period: Time off accrues but cannot be used until after
    the probationary period is complete.

  - After Probationary Period: Accrued time off may be used. Additional time
    off beyond accrued amounts is unpaid.

  - Requesting Time Off: Notify your supervisor as far in advance as possible.
    For extended absences, please provide at least two weeks' notice when
    feasible.

SICK TIME

Sick time is currently unpaid. However, you may use accrued vacation time for
illness if you prefer. If you're unwell, please notify your supervisor as soon
as possible. We understand that illness happens—just keep communication open.

================================================================================
                          4. COMPENSATION
================================================================================

PAY SCHEDULE

Compensation is paid on a weekly basis. Specific payment terms, including rate
and method of payment, are outlined in your individual contract or offer letter.

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

If you are engaged as an independent contractor, you are responsible for:
  - Your own tax obligations and filings
  - Providing accurate invoices as required
  - Maintaining any necessary business licenses or registrations

BENEFITS

At this time, Abacus Data Consulting does not offer traditional employee benefits
such as health insurance or retirement plans. This may change as the company
grows. Any future benefits will be communicated and documented separately.

EXPENSES

Any work-related expenses must be pre-approved before being incurred. Approved
expenses will be reimbursed according to the terms agreed upon with your
supervisor.

================================================================================
                    5. CONDUCT & COMMUNICATION
================================================================================

PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

We expect all team members to:
  - Act with integrity and professionalism
  - Treat colleagues, clients, and partners with respect
  - Communicate honestly and constructively
  - Take ownership of your work and commitments

COMMUNICATION TOOLS

We currently use the following tools for coordination:
  - Email (primary communication)
  - GitHub (project collaboration and code management)
  - Text messaging (quick coordination as needed)

You are expected to check communications regularly and respond within a
reasonable timeframe. "Reasonable" varies by situation—urgent client matters
require quicker responses than routine internal updates. Use good judgment.

DRESS CODE

For non-client-facing roles, there is no formal dress code.

For client meetings (including video calls), please dress appropriately for
the context. Business casual is generally suitable unless the client
relationship calls for something more formal.

HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION

Abacus Data Consulting has zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, or
bullying of any kind. This includes but is not limited to:
  - Verbal, physical, or visual harassment
  - Discrimination based on protected characteristics
  - Creating a hostile or intimidating work environment
  - Retaliation against anyone who reports concerns

If you experience or witness such behavior, report it immediately. All reports
will be taken seriously and investigated promptly.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

You must disclose any potential conflicts of interest to your supervisor. This
includes but is not limited to:
  - Work or business relationships with competitors
  - Financial interests that could influence your judgment
  - Personal relationships that could affect business decisions
  - Outside work that could conflict with your responsibilities here

When in doubt, disclose. We'd rather discuss a potential conflict than discover
an undisclosed one later.

SOCIAL MEDIA

You are free to use social media personally. However:
  - Do not represent your personal opinions as those of Abacus Data Consulting
  - Do not share confidential company or client information
  - Be mindful that your online presence can reflect on the company
  - Comply with any non-disclosure agreements you have signed

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS

Depending on your role and the clients you work with, you may be required to
sign specific non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). These are legally binding and
must be taken seriously. Violations can result in termination and legal action.

essential:
